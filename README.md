# ClubGolf Mini
ClubGolf Mini is a multiplayer golf game using [socket.io](https://socket.io/). Host a server and play golf with friends! 

Maps are made in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/); both the .tmx source files and the exported .json files are present. The music is made from MIDI files, converted to MML with a custom python script. See the util folder for the source .mids and more! The tiles and other textures were made in [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/).

ClubGolf Mini can be run locally or hosted! If playing the game locally, simply run the index.html file.
